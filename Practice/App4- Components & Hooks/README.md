# App 4 Components & Hooks
- Make 3 components: GameControl. Odd and Even
- Game Control must have 2 buttons one to start game and one to pause it
- When start game is clicked: Continuously emit a new event and store a reference to this time in a propery
- On each event tick there should be a number that should be listenable on the outside
- On clicking the pause button clear the interval

Odd and even are custom components that should generate a new component when an odd or even number is generated by the controller.
