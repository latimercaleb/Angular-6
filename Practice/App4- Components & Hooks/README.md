# App 4 Components & Hooks
-  Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
- Game Control must have 2 buttons one to start game and one to stop it
- When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
-  The event should be listenable from outside the component
- On each event tick there should be a number that should be listenable on the outside
- On clicking the stop button clear the interval
- When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))
- A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
- Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
- Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
